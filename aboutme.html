		<h1 class="heading"> Matthew Castillo </h1>
			<p> Hello everyone, my name is Matthew Castillo. I was born on January 3rd 1995, which currently makes me 20 years old. This is my auto-biography, I am writing this because I want the world to know who I am as one day I plan to be the most inspirational being to have ever wandered the earth.

		<h2 class="heading"> My Number One Dream </h2>
			<p> I think when introducing myself, it is only proper to begin with my goal in life, "what drives me to wake up every single morning and continue to have an existance". First, the main reason I wake-up is because everyday I know someone, somewhere, does not, and this alone gives me enough reason to appreciate the value of time and to understand how limited it is when it comes to working towards leaving an impact on the world. The second reason I wake up (and really my number one reason), is because I strive to be the Greatest Hip-Hop Emcee to have ever existed, period. I have big dreans, and even a bigger mindset to achieve these dreams, although like any man I have fallbacks, and imperfections. My main fallback is my lack of contribution towards my goal, my craft. I tend to blame this on being "busy" but truly I can never use that as an accurate excuse, as 2Pac once said "If you can't find something to live for, you best find something to die for," and if this is what I'd die for than no other obstacle should stand in my pursuit of it.

		<h3 class="heading"> Something To Die For </h3>
			<p> <span id="selfquote">"I love Hip-Hop music, I'd ride for Hip-Hop Music, I'd take nine for Hip-Hop Music, I'd die for Hip-Hop Music"- M.E.C.</span> Its true, Hip-Hop music is my life, my secret number one Hobby I try keeping secret because I don't want others to know about. I don't want anyone knowing my ambition to impact it (at least not yet), not until I feel I can release content that does good to the craft. Therefore, I live life working on smaller ambitions of mine and presenting them as my primary focus, like my drive to become a Video-Game Designer is a real thing, it is something I would not mind having accomplished, something I do seek, but if I never even tried making my first dream happen, than to be honest it was a wasted effort, an effort I would always feel didn't live up to my number one dream, my full potential, my "something to die for".
